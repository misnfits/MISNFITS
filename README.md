[BYI - Before You Interact] I do not roleplay or do ship related interactions. But I'm open to conversation!

[DNI - Do Not Interact]
Basic dni criteria. Pro/darkshippers, inhumane acts apologists, people who interact with the weird sides of fandoms.

[GENERAL] 
I am not very active on pt; I mostly just like making skins. Feel free to ask for my discord if you'd like to chat more. My replies might be slow.
